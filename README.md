## Scope of Project :

* This project is designed keeping in mind the hostel room allocation for any institution. Students must have an ID given by the institution/Administration to be eligible to get a room via the application.
* Application also considers the visitors and also maintains the database for them.
Institute-hostel communication is established as when a studentâ€™s database is removed from the institute, then the room allocation is automatically cancelled as that student id becomes invalid.
* Availability of rooms is also communicated to the newcomer at the time of room allocation.
